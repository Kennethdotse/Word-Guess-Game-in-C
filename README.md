# Word-Guess-Game-in-C
This is a repository for a group project on a word guess game written in C. The game basically takes user input depending on the difficulty level chosen by the player and it generates a random word the user can guess giving the player as many clues as it can.

So you start playing from level one and as you end each level you advance into a much difficult level. You would have to attain a certain threshold mark before you can unlock some levels.
This project is a console application and was written in C.
